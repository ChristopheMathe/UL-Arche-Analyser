# 📘 Arche Analyser

A PyQt6 application to extract students’ highest grades between class schedule intervals.

# 📖 Overview

Arche Analyser is a desktop application built with PyQt6 that processes CSV files exported from the Arche e-learning platform of the University of Lorraine.

Its main purpose is to:
 - Load and visualize CSV files generated by Arche
 - Define or edit class schedules
 - Optionally filter students
 - Compute each student’s highest grade recorded during class times

This tool is especially useful for instructors who want to analyze student engagement or identify highest achieved scores within specific time blocks.

# 🚀 Features

  ## 🔍 CSV File Analysis
  - Open CSV files from Arche (.csv)
  - Automatically displays the file name and content in a table

  ## 🕓 Schedule Handling
  - Create, edit, and manage class schedules
  - Store multiple class profiles
  - Validate date-time formats automatically

  ## 🎯 Student Filtering
  - Optional filtering of students before computing results

  ## 📊 Highest Grade Computation
  - Extract the highest grade for each student occurring within the selected schedule intervals
  - Results displayed in a dedicated window (WidgetResult)

# 🧮 How Computation Works

1. The user selects or defines the class schedule (one or multiple start/end datetime pairs).

2. The CSV file is opened with the OPEN toolbar action.

3. Optionally, the user filters students.

4. Clicking Compute:
    - The app scans all timestamps in the CSV
    - Keeps only those falling inside the defined schedule ranges
    - Computes the maximum grade for each student during these intervals
    - Displays the results in a new window

# 🧩 Modular Architecture

The UI is organized into the following custom widgets:

| Component           | Description                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ToolBar`           | Provides the **OPEN** action to load CSV files                   |
| `WidgetQuery`       | Class selector, schedule editor, filters, and **Compute** button |
| `WidgetFileContent` | Displays file name and CSV table                                 |
| `WidgetResult`      | Shows computed highest scores                                    |
| `TwoColumnWidget`   | Manages start/end time schedules                                 |
